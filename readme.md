### Xampp

- [FIRST, install XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/download.html).
- [THEN, install composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

During the composer installation you will be asked about the path. If you install XAMPP first, the Composer will get the XAMPP path by default. This is exactly what you need.

## How to execute laravel project

Windows (accessing Xampp htdocs folder)
Ubuntu (accessing /var/www/html)

...Then...  
> cd [nome_projeto]
composer install (to install dependencies. "php artisan" doesn't work without this step)

Renaming .env.example in project folder to .env  
> php artisan key:generate (this step create an APP_KEY inside .env file. It's important)

Edit the following lines in .env file:  
> DB_CONNECTION=(your DB)  
DB_PORT=3306(your DB port)  
DB_DATABASE=(your DB schema)  
DB_USERNAME=(your DB username)  
DB_PASSWORD=(your DB password)  
AUTH_API_TOKEN=(a password to access the API)

There is a configuration example in .env.txt file. The example uses MySql as DB.  
DON'T change the APP_KEY line that you just created in .env.

#### Windows
> php artisan serve (after this step the laravel app is available)

#### Ubuntu
> sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart

## Database

It's necessary to create a schema in DB according to DB configurations in .env.
Then, let's create tables in DB according to migrates classes declared in project:
> php artisan migrate (to rollback the last creation/migrate, execute php artisan migrate:rollback)
